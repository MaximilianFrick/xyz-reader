# XYZReader
Fifth project of Android Developer Nanodegree course (Udacity). XYZReader is a mock RSS feed reader featuring banner photos and shocking headlines!

## What has been done
On a code basis given from Udacity, the goal was to improve the design of the app, keeping following aspects in mind:
* Make the app material ([Material Guidelines](https://material.io/guidelines/))
* Added [CollapsingToolbar](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/CollapsingToolbarLayout.html)
* Improve functional behaviours
